## Overview

While revisiting my [Rivenbot](https://github.com/riven-of-a-thousand-servers) project
I tried redeploying one of the services I had created a while ago: A Rotating-Reverse Proxy.
There are two major reasons as to why I needed a RR-proxy: First, my project
relied on having an up-to-date database of user activity, and my only
source of real-time data came from a REST API exposed by Bungie itself, and
second, Bungie's rate limits makes it impossible to stay in track with the
influx of generated data for players using a single IP address. Therefore,
using several IPv6 addresses would help me circumvent this issue, within the
"legal" confines of bypassing rate-limits set by developers of course.
Having talked and confirmed with the API developers that as long as
bandwidth is not abuse we are allowed to scrape with multiple IPs lightens up
worrying about legal issues!

The proxy itself is very simple: It attaches to one of the network interfaces
in the host, given that the interface has routable and valid IPs attached
to it, then it just simply round-robins through the provided IPs as
requests come in, whilst at the same time rate-limiting requests based
on the target URL path and the domain provided.

This all sounds pretty straight forward and even more so if I were to deploy
the proxy right on top of the host's network. However, I created Rivenbot using
containerization for all its services with the help of Docker Swarm for managing
machines across different locations. This puts complicates deploying the proxy
as a standalone program in a host machine. However, to understand
how IPvlan solved my issue, its good to understand the benefits of
the Routing Mesh provided by Docker Swarm.

## Primer on Docker Swarm's Routing Mesh

Docker Swarm handles host/node service discovery and load-balancing through
[overlay networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/overlay/).
Overlay networks are networks that allow communication between two hosts on
different networks by using a technology called VXLan. This, combined with gateway
bridges created by Swarm on each node creates a behavior called
_Routing Mesh_. The routing mesh itself makes it easy for outside clients to
access Swarm services through their published ports without knowing specific IP
addresses and port combinations for any replicated services. It makes
it easy to access, for example, a web-server container replicated
three times across 3 different hosts without the client knowing
a specific `[host:port]` combination. Additionally, Swarm offers embedded
DNS resolutions for services running in the Swarm through their service name.
Instead of referring to Nginx by their IP address, you could make a request to
`http://nginx` and the DNS would resolve to the appropriate Nginx container.

This is a big oversimpliciation of how the routing mesh works, but hopefully
the point across is made that this behavior simplifies a lot of headaches when
it comes to distributed networking and Docker containers. This same
behavior is something that I still wanted to utilize in my project, which
meant that my original approach for deploying my RR-proxy was wrong.

## The Problem with Host networking and Docker Swarm

My first instinct to solve my problem was to use Docker's [Host network driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/)
so my proxy would have direct access to the host network stack and avoid any
container-networking shenaningans. However, there was a big
caveat to using this driver with Docker Swarm: Using it alongside
Docker Swarm bypasses the routing mesh that gives me natural port publishing,
load balancing and DNS resolution across my services and my nodes.
The biggest benefit of these three that I did not want to
give up was **DNS resolution**. I wanted to have
the convenience of calling my Swarm services by its service name and have
the cluster be able to resolve to the right container seamlessly, including
the proxy service. And even though I was able to configure it using
Docker Stack:

```yaml
# docker-stack.yaml

services:
  proxy-service:
    image: rivenbot/proxy-service:${PROXY_SERVICE_VERSION:-latest}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8081/healthcheck"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
    networks:
      - outside
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.hostname==proxy-service-droplet
          - node.role==worker

# This is how you reference the host network
# from within a compose file
networks:
  outside:
    external:
      name: "host"
```

I even opened a [pull request in Docker Docs](https://www.github.com/docker/docs/pulls/)
to see if this super niche compose configuration should be added to the Docker docs
(It was not approved by the way). This was my original setup from
months before I came back to continue the project. Even though the PR was
rejected it did highlight something that one of the maintainers said in
response to this change: "This is not the intended use of Docker Swarm", which
made me realize that this was not the right approach to the problem. It was
the easy approach, but not the best one.

## IPvlan Network to the rescue

Months later, after some thorough research, very well-crafted prompts (not really),
and reading the available network drivers that were available with Docker,
I stumbled upon both the [IPVlan](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/ipvlan)
and [Macvlan](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/macvlan) network drivers.
They seemed like an intriguing idea for solving my issue, however,
behind layers of Linux's abstractions and primitives I did not really understand
how they worked and how they would solve my problem for my proxy. It was
then that I sat and studied Linux IPvlan driver. As it
turns out, I had to backtrack a little before I fully understood IPvlan, since
there were a few gaps in my knowledge regarding networking in general. For this
I reviewed topics that were related such as the Link Layer (Layer 2) and MAC
addresses, Linux Namespaces, Linux bridges, and their parallel structure
to Layer 2 packet switches + ethernet. These topics were in tangent with IPvlan
and it led me to understand the exact problem that it was trying to solve, promptly
realizing that this was the solution to my problem with the proxy.

## What I discovered

The IPvlan Linux driver acts itself as a very light-weight middle-man
between the container, and the host network. In comparison to other networks drivers,
IPvlan and Macvlan kind of push the boundaries of network isolation in general.
Whereas the normal bridge driver completely isolates containers from the host,
due to it acting as a network switch and ethernet cables, the cables being
virtual ethernet pairs, and the switch being a Linux bridge,
the host driver offers little-to-no isolation since the container would
share the same network stack as the host. Both IPvlan and Macvlan are in
a gray area in-between these two drivers, or at least that's how
I like to think about them. IPvlan requires three things: a parent interface
to attach to, the host's subnet, and the host's gateway IP. Given this three
parameters, once you create and attach your container to the IPVlan network
two interesting things will happen:

1. When the container is spun up, it will have a routable IP address from within
   the same CIDR block as the one you specified by both the `gateway` and
   `subnet` parameters
2. The IPvlan construct will create a network interface with the same MAC address
   as the parent's interface MAC address, this is how you know which interface
   inside the container belongs to your IPvlan network

There were some quirks as well from how I configured my proxy to use this new
network, the first one was that my very simple proxy relied on attaching to a
well-known network interface. In my case, the proxy would attach to `eth0` by
default since it had access to the host's network stack and the existance
of this network interface was a given. Now however, not only does my container
have the network interface created by the IPvlan driver, but also it contains
the interface created by the ingress network for the routing mesh, and a
user-made overlay network for service communication. This brings it to a
grand-total of 3+ ethernet interfaces in my container. The question is: To which
of these interfaces should I bind my IPs to and how do I do it?

The answer is a little obvious once you realize that if my application previously
chose the interface `eth0` one a whim, it can still choose the interface, however
now it has to do so dynamically. To know which interface my proxy has to attach
is pretty simple, given a subnet that was previously declared for the IPvlan
network, find the interface that has an IP that belongs to that subnet.
Remember that the IPvlan construct will assign a routable IP address to the
container based on the gateway and the subnet given at creation time.

In my proxy the code relevant to dynamic interface discovery is the following:

```go
  _, targetSubnet, err := net.ParseCIDR("2604:a880:4:1d0::/64")
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Unable to parse CIDR block: %v", err)
  }

  var ipv6interface string
Outer:
  for _, i := range interfaces {
      addresses, err := i.Addrs()
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Error reading addresses for interface %s: %v", i.Name, err)
      }
      for _, a := range addresses {
          ip, ok := a.(*net.IPNet)
          if !ok {
              log.Fatalf("Cannot assert type *net.IPNet from %T", ip)
          }

          if targetSubnet.Contains(ip.IP) {
              ipv6interface = i.Name
              break Outer
          }
      }
  }
```
